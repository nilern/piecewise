* [ ] Proof variables
* [ ] Parser

# Passes

* [ ] Properly working lexer (may need to be hand-coded)
* [ ] Desugaring delimcc operations (and their interaction with the dynamic environment)
* [ ] Pass that adds type, bounds etc. checks (using the proof variables)
* [ ] Continuation closures
* [ ] Instruction selection
* [ ] Register allocation
